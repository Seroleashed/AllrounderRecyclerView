# AllrounderRecyclerView
This RecyclerView-Version shall simplified the usage of an advanced RecyclerView which is capable of handling drag-and-drop, partial swipe and swipe-to-dismiss as well as headers and footers.

So far, my implementation is capable of drag-and-drop and swipe-to-dismiss. This read-me will be updated whenever new features are added.

I am happy about any help I get, especially with making this repository in a way it is good for being used as a small library.
